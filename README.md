## To-do
- Finish up `string` module notebook
- Think about corresponding web app for randomly generating a Python module
  - Could generate on a weekly schedule
  - Would also need to let user change it for themselves if they don't like it
  - User-generated alternatives would not be stored in sessions, so it will change each time
- Create config files to work with Binder for executable notebooks
